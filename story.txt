Once upon a time there was a man named Eric. Eric lived in the downtown part of Madison, Wisconsin. One day while Eric was walking to class, he saw a golden bottle in the snow. When he picked it up, a genie popped out and told Eric he would grant him 3 wishes.

The genie asked Eric what he desired most in the world. Eric said he wasn't sure and thought it over for some time before ansering the genie.

Eric had a hard time walking in the snow because it was so cold outside. He made a wish to the genie "I want the warmest clothes in the world." Then, he got a coat that can generate heat.

Eric also was having a rough time in his classes. He decided to wish for a personal tutor for all of his classes. Now he could have someone to help with all of his assignments.
